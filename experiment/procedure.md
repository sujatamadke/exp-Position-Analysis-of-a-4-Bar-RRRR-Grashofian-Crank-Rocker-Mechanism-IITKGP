### Procedure
In this experiment you will guided through the position analysis of a 4 bar RRRR Grashofian Crank Rocker. Like a double crank, in a crank rocker the crank, which in this case is the link 2 does rotate through a full circle. But unlike a double crank, in a crank rocker, the follower, which in this case is the link 4, will NOT rotate through a full circle, and there will be a lower and upper limit for the values of theta 4.

The methods of position analysis of a Crank Rocker are the same as that for a double crank. Using complex numbers is a popular analytical approach. The location of the coupler point can also be determined graphically. An animated description of the analytical as well as graphical methods are provided in the following links.

Unlike the Double Crank, if we try to analytically find out the extrema of the roots of theta 4 by taking derivative of theta 4 with respect to theta 2 and setting the value to zero, it will ultimately be seen that the values are non zero and different, implying that there is a range of values of theta 4. However the simple geometrical consideration that in the extreme configurations, the 4 bar linkage will form a triangle lets us easily find the limits both analytically and graphically. The following animations show the analytical and graphical methods.

### Demo

Animation of a 4 Bar Crank Rocker

Clicking on the buttons will rotate the crank in the directions indicated. The slider can be used for controlled rotation.
The view can be rotated about a point by keeping the left mouse button pressed and rotating the mouse.
The view can be translated by keeping the right mouse button pressed and translating the mouse in the desired direction
The scroll button or middle mouse button can be used for zooming.
The view can be rotated about the coordinate axes by using the left (<--) and right (-->) keys and the Page Up and Page Down keys on the keyboard.
Using the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys will move the view towards or away from the viewer..
The - and + (or Shift + =) keys may be used for zooming out and zooming in.
Pressing the = key will get the view back to default.
